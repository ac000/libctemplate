This branch (otl) of libctemplate, just contains the library code and not the
examples, test or template program.

This branch has only minor modifications from upstream.

    1) The inclusion of fcgi_stdio.h in ctemplate.c

This is to make it work in a FastCGI environment.

    2) Build the library as a dynamic shared object (.so)

Previously the library was being built as a static package (.a)
