This branch (otl) of libctemplate, just contains the library code and not the
examples, test or template program.

This branch has only minor modifications from upstream.

    1) The building of two versions of the library, fcgi and non-fcgi

Use ctemplate-fcgi when using fcgi_stdio.h from FastCGI

    2) Build the library as a dynamic shared object (.so)

Previously the library was being built as a static package (.a)
