This branch (otl) of libctemplate, just contains the library code and not the
examples, test or template program.

This branch has only minor modifications from upstream.

    1) The building of three versions of the library, fcgi, fcgx and non-fcgi

Use libctemplate-fcgi when using the FCGI_ stdio wrapper API.
Use libctemplate-fcgx when using the FCGX_ API

    2) Build the library as a dynamic shared object (.so)

Previously the library was being built as a static package (.a)
